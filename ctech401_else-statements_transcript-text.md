Now that we know more about the comparison part of an if let's look in more detail at the body. Here is a program that has the same animal logic but a couple of more print statements added to it. Let's see how this one works. So if I give this one the input dog, it says "Cool, I like dogs too. Thank you. Goodbye." How did this work? We saw that the user had typed in dog that goes into the if body, it prints "Cool, I like dogs too." Then it goes to the next one with the body and prints. "Thank you." Now that it's done with the if body it goes to the first statement after the body and prints "Goodbye." But if I run this program and I type cat instead then since the entire condition is false, Python skips the entire if body. It goes right to the line afterwards and prints goodbye. The indentation in this is very important. Here's a version where we didn't indent the thank you. It will be executed regardless of whether the condition is true or false. The condition in an if statement determines whether Python executes the unit body if it does executes the whole thing. So this one if I give it dog it behaves the same way, but if I run this program and type cat it prints both thank you and goodbye since the thank you was part of what followed the if rather than the body of the if. Here is a version that asks separately about dogs and cats, it's a version with two if statements. Each of them has its own condition and it's own body. If the user input dog, Python executes the first indented block. Either way, control will continue with the next line after that if body which is another if statement. This time if the user input cat, Python executes the second indented block. Either way control connects with the next line after that second if body which is to print goodbye. I run this one, I say dog, it goes like, I like dogs too. If I run this one, I say cat, it will say cats are okay. Either way, it will print the goodbye thoughtless them both. Here is a version that has a useful variation on that logic. This version is two indebted blocks but only one if statement. The first indented block is like we've been through an if body, it's executed if the condition is true. The second one which follows else is executed if that condition was false, basically do this or else do that. This is very useful when there are exactly two possibilities and they need different treatment. So this immersion I give a dog, it says it likes dogs, if I give a cat it says a dog could be better. Either the if body or the else body.
