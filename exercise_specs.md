# # Exercise Title: If-Else Statements in Python
---
# Instructional Requirements
## Key Technical Outcome
<em>Use an if-else statement to control program flow.</em>

## Exercise Context
<em>In this exercise you will be controlling which statements in your code are executed using an if-else statement. You will be testing multiple inputs to verify that all statements are executing correctly. </em>

## Exercise Instructions
<em>You are given starting code (starter_code.py) that stores input in the variable color and prints the output Goodbye. 

Your goal in this exercise will be to use an if-else statement to give the user appropriate output on their favorite color guess. 

First, create an if statement that checks the input for your favorite color. (Assume all lowercase characters).

If the user inputs the favorite color correctly, output a message to the screen indicating this. 

Test multiple inputs to verify that your if statment only outputs a message when the correct color is entered. 

Now, add an else statement, to output a message letting the user know that they guessed incorrectly. 

Test multiple inputs to verify that the else is working correctly.

# Technical Requirements
<em><strong>If these aren't distinct from what is specified in the course and module-level specs, you can leave these blank.</strong></em>

## Environment/s Used
<em>Here is where you indicate environments that the student will work in. Such as: code editor with browser preview, command line with virtual desktop for previewing plots, or unique environments such as RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, etc...</em>

## Language/s Used
<em>Indicate any languages used that are unique to this exercise (this is quite rare).</em>

## Package/s Required
<em>Indicate here any unique packages that need to be installed for the exercise to function.</em>

# Test Requirements
<em>The student needs to have correctly used an if and else in the code. The if statement should check for the correct input (a string value of the variable color) and should trigger the appropriate output statement. An incorrect input (anything other than the value of the variable color) should trigger at least one output statement. </em>

## Outcome Tests
<em>When the code is executed, entering the the string value used in the if statement's condition results in a positive output message. Entering any other input, runs the else statement. </em>

## Student Code Tests
<em>This relates to specific aspects of the student's code which need to be assessed. The best way to indicate these requirements is with comments in your solution code file, indicating the parts of the code which need to be verified. This helps make the requirements less abstract. However, if you have any requirements that are better explained long form, please do so below.</em>

## Process Tests
<em>Indicate here criteria that should be tested relating to the process by which the student reached their outcomes in the exercise.</em>
