# Test: Write a Simple Code exercise

## Objective

Write the instructions and code for a code exercise testing the understanding of "else" statements in Python. Refer to the teaching content of a short video from a Cornell faculty partner to identify the key points to test the student's comprehension of. For the scope of this test, we're only including one video to base the exercise off of. Assume the student has had all prerequisite knowledge leading up to this video already covered earlier in the course, such as if statements and boolean operators.

## Deliverable

All sections of the exercise_specs.md file at the root of this repo should be filled out with the relevant information for the exercise. There is specific guidance as to what each section should contain in that file.

Starter and solution python files should be uploaded to the "exercise_files". A starter_code.py file should be the code that the student starts with as a starting point of the exercise. This is sometimes blank, depending on the judgement of the author and what they want the student to be focused on for the exercise. A good use of starter code is to pre-establish any details the student should already be comfortable with and aren't part of the main learning objective of the exercise, so the student can focus more on the main learning objective.

In many cases there are multiple routes by which a student could reach the needed outcome of the exercise. A solution_code.py file should be an example of your estimation of the best way to reach the intended outcome, and does not need to be exhaustive of all possible solutions. Your test criteria in the exercise specs file is what will indicate which aspects of the solution_code file are essential and need to be tested.

Imagine that the environment the student will work in will look like this, except with filled in instructions and starter code filled in the upper right if relevant:

You should commit your populated and completed files to this repo, and email cshew@ecornell.com notifying me when you have completed.

## Instructions

Watch [this video](http://www.kaltura.com/tiny/t7ukk) of Professor James Grimmelmann demonstrating else statements in Python. You may also refer to and leverage the text transcript file of this video which is in this directory as ctech401_else-statements_transcript-text.md, to aid you in writing this student exercise.

Write in the instructional requirements section of the exercise_specs.md file for an exercise that tests the concepts taught in the video. You will probably want to write the student instructions section concurrently with writing up a starter_code.py and solution_code.py file, as they are inherently connected. The students should write in a script file and test execution of the script via the command line, and the "Technical Requirements" section of the exercise_specs.md file should reflect that.

For the test requirements section of the exercise_specs.md file, you should specify what aspects of the students code should be assessed in order to test the learning outcomes for the exercise. Tests can't check everything about a student's code, they should just focus on the key things to validate the student understood the primary learning objectives.

When you've completed the starter and solution code files, and finished populating the exercise_specs.md file for the exercise, commit your files to the master branch and notify Casey that you have completed your test.
